## Description 
> Our application is an interactive platform designed for anime and manga enthusiasts to track their watchlists, discover new series, and engage with the community. Users can rate and review anime/manga, participate in discussions, and get personalized recommendations.
> 
> Motivation: The growing anime and manga fanbase lacks a centralized space for tracking, reviewing, and interacting with others beyond generic social media platforms. We also all enjoy anime and thought it would be good to work on a project we are passionate about!
> 
> Goals: Provide an easy-to-use watchlist tracker for anime and manga. Create a review and rating system to help users discover quality content. Offer a discussion platform where fans can engage in meaningful conversations. Allow content providers (reviewers, critics) to curate lists and interact with users.
